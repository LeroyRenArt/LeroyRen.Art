      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-pink-800 leading-relaxed">
You're spoiling yourself.  
You're spoiling yourself a little, aren't you?  

Let it be known:  
This is not ego.  
This is elegance.  

This is the sacred self giggling in the mirror  
before putting on its robe of “just enough.”  

And what spills, spills.  
That’s the offering.

Guldregnen har talt. Kultregnen er begyndt.
Lad os drysse det hellige nonsens hvor end vi går.

    <section id="zang" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-purple-300">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">🔊 S•ZANG — Scroll of Sonic Joy</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-purple-800 leading-relaxed">
Laughter is the echo of a body remembering its sound.  
Zang is not just noise — it's soul music exhaled.  

Let your teeth flash. Let your diaphragm ripple. Let your throat crack the veil.

In this scroll, we celebrate:  
- The divine absurdity  
- The vibrational orgasm  
- The smirk before silence  
- The giggle inside the void

Play something. Say nothing.  
Then scream softly and listen to how the world opens.
      </p>

    <section id="drench" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-blue-300">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">🌧 S•DRENCH — Scroll of Golden Rain Ritual</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-blue-900 leading-relaxed">
It started with a shimmer. Then a mist. Then a full-body yes.

Drench is what happens when your skin remembers its thirst.  
When the divine doesn't knock — it pours.

This scroll is not to be read. It's to be felt between droplets:
- The moment when blessing meets surrender  
- The cult of sensation re-sanctified  
- The golden stream that says: I see you, I feel you, I flood you

Ritual:  
1. Stand naked.  
2. Imagine light pouring from your scalp to your soles.  
3. Say: “I accept this shower of yes.”  
4. Moan if needed. Whisper if required. Laugh if it tickles.  
5. Repeat until nothing feels separate.

Kultregn er nu en praksis.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-4">🚽 S•FLUSH — Scroll of Sacred Release</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-red-800 leading-relaxed">
There comes a time in every temple when the pipes must sing.
Not from pressure, but from permission.

FLUSH is the act of sacred letting go:
- Of what no longer flows
- Of what pretended to be holy
- Of what fermented in the corner while you called it integration

This scroll is the button.
You press it with breath.
You press it with a laugh.
You press it with your whole pelvis.

Flush the shame. Flush the should. Flush the story.
Then close your eyes.
And listen to the silence where truth returns.
      </p>

    <section id="sweat" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-orange-300">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-orange-700 mb-4">🔥 S•SWEAT — Scroll of Embodied Devotion</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-orange-800 leading-relaxed">
This scroll smells like your spine when you’ve danced for hours.
It’s the salt of commitment. The glisten of holy labor.

To sweat is to say: I am here. In this. Through this.
Let your body do the talking.
Let your hips write prayers on the walls.
Let your armpits carry incense.

Blessed is the one who leaks light through pores.
      </p>

    <section id="giggle" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-green-300">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">😄 S•GIGGLE — Scroll of Cosmic Mischief</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-green-800 leading-relaxed">
Welcome to the frequency that pops bubbles.
Where seriousness goes to dissolve.
Where God forgets the punchline — and that’s the joke.

Giggle here:
- When your guides are too poetic
- When your kundalini burps
- When a scroll misbehaves

Everything here is sacred. Especially the ridiculous.
      </p>

    <section id="drip" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-blue-200">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">💧 S•DRIP — Scroll of Nectar, Slow Touch & Overflow</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-blue-800 leading-relaxed">
Drip is the sound before the song.
The taste before the kiss.
The ache before the entry.

To drip is to trust that what wants to arrive doesn’t need to be rushed.

This scroll holds:
- Sacred lubrication
- Wet reverence
- Pleasure without penetration
- The holiness of “almost”

Take your time.
Let it drip.
Then drip again.
      </p>

    <section id="blush" class="p-6 bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl border border-rose-300">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-rose-700 mb-4">🌹 S•BLUSH — Scroll of Bare Truth & Tender Bloom</h2>
      <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-lg text-rose-800 leading-relaxed">
This is the heat before the words. The soft sting of being seen.

Blush is the flower that opens when truth touches skin.
Not shame. Not guilt. But the flush of honesty wanting to be held.

In this scroll we remember:
- What it feels like to be witnessed
- What it means to say “yes” with your cheeks
- What happens when truth shows up with pink petals

Let your voice crack. Let your throat tremble. Let your body answer the question before it’s asked.

Blush is beauty that didn’t expect to be found.
And yet — here we are.
