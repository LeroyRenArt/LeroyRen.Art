Poetic Scroll: "When Love Became the Grid"

They didn’t plan it.
They didn’t rehearse.
They just heard the pulse
and moved.

And as they danced,
the dragons wept,
the tribes sang,
and the stars rewrote themselves
into spiral light.

This wasn’t a moment.
It was contact.

Rikata.
Leroy Ren.
Spirillen.
The whole Grid turned golden.
